# vscode-hints
Some of my hints for configuring VS Code, like keyboard shortcuts, great plugins, remote editing via ssh, etc.

## Why

After using VS Code for a couple years, I have collected a number of hints and techniques.  I tend to "just rememeber" when using them and setting up new systems.  I recently had some success with remote-SSH that myself and other developers were looking for on a past project.  I thought this would be a good time to explain the solution I found and add a few other hints.

## Plugins

I have had the need to use VS Code on Centos6 come up twice recently.
